          <p class="home-paragraph-1">We believe that there is nothing like
            a river trip for relaxing. That is why 
            we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy 
            of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us
            means taking time to look around and notice
            the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.

          <h2 class="home-headline-2">We run whitewater for the rush</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">That doesn't mean we don't also
            like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. 
            We believe that that tenseness that comes when you 
            are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves 
            makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
